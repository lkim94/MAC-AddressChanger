# MAC Address Changer
A simple Python program that allows to change the MAC address of a network interface.
This is to be used for educational and security testing purposes only and I'm not responsible for the misuse of this program.

This program was tested on Kali Linux.

# Usage
sudo python3 MAC-Changer.py -i <interface_name> -m <new_mac_address>
